Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple (e,e), which corresponds to its scores by Rater A (human) and Rater B (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that O corresponds to the number of images that received a rating i by A and a rating j by B. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An N-by-N histogram matrix of expected ratings, E, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that E and O have the same sum.

Submissions should be formatted like:

id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
